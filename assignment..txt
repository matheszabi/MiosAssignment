Assignment sent in mail:

Build an app that displays a list as on attached mockup.
To get the list of items you need to make a call to https://veramobile.mios.com/test/android/items.test
The list must be sorted by PK_Device(this is the same with SN from the mocks) and must have a header with a picture and your name.

The item icon is displayed depending on "Platform" key:
"Sercomm G450" -> vera_plus_big
"Sercomm G550" -> vera_secure_big
"MiCasaVerde VeraLite" -> vera_edge_big
"Sercomm NA900" -> vera_edge_big
"Sercomm NA301" -> vera_edge_big
"Sercomm NA930" -> vera_edge_big
no platform key -> vera_edge_big

The resources: vera_edge_big.png, vera_plus_big.png, vera_secure_big.png can be found in

https://veramobile.mios.com/test/android/drawable-xxxhdpi

On item click open a new page that has the same header and the item details.
On item long click a dialog must be displayed with delete option and two button ok and cancel. On delete selected the item must be removed from list, on cancel the user must see the same list.


You have 2h 30m to solve. In the first 30 m you can ask me anything about the requirements. At the end of the time I want to receive an archive with the written code.
